       login, logout, directory, profile, and headers pug files. We also have a store-server, database-initializer , registration, 
       login, logout, orderform, profile js files.
Purpose: The purpose of this was to learn how to use mongodb and express-sesions efficiently. 
         We learned how to create a mongodb callection and update an exiting collection as well as using querys to find specific information.
         

How to run the server: After opening the terminal, install the node modules by typing npm install. Then, with the monogo daemon and mongo 
                            client open, run the database-initializer .js file to initialize the required collections, then run the server.js 
                            file and go to http://localhost:3000/ to get on the home page
